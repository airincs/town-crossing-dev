# Introduction - Town Crossing!

Welcome to Town Crossing Development!

The client folder contains the front-end source code, while the server folder contains the back-end source code.
I specialize in front-end development, and I rely heavily on documentation when developing back-ends. I am currently learning how to work with the back-end, but I'm not fully comfortable yet!

Note: This is the original development repository with the appropriate history. If you wish to see the deployed repository: (https://github.com/airincs/town-crossing-client)
